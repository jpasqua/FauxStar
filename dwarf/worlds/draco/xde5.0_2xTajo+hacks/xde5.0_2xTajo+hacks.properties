#
# Sample Draco configuration for a manual installation of XDE 5.0 with 2 Tajo bootfiles
# installed from floppy images over the XDE-5.0 micropolis 6085 disk at Bitsavers
# 
# Many programs (so-called "unsupported tools" or "hacks") from on various floppy images
# for XDE 5.0 on 8010 or 6085 were copied to the main partition, some are started when
# the system is booted
# 
# (all floppies can be found at Bitsavers)
#

# Warning: not all XDE shutdown options work correctly:
# - "Boot button" from the HeraldWindow context menu works (system can be restarted)
# - "Quit" from the "Exec Ops" desktop background menu works (equivalent to "Boot button")
# - "Power off"  from the "Exec Ops" desktop background menu locks up the system (MP goes
#   back to 0990 after transiting through 0910/0920) but the system can be started normally
#   after killing Dwarf/Draco
#
# So best is to shutdown the system with tne "Boot button" menu...
#

#
# ####### general settings for booting the system
#

# absolute or relative path to the pilot disk to boot (main disk)
#
# required

# number of delta files for the main disk file to keep when the system
# is shut down

#
# optional, default: false

# fallback-germ if the germ on the pilot disk is not loadable
#
# (Draco attempts to load the germ from the pilot disk, locating the germ-file
# through the physical volume table in the very first sector; if this fails,
# e.g. no germ is installed or it is not in a contiguous sector range, then
# the fallback-germ will be loaded from the file system, as with dwarf)

# ####### UI settings
#

# title to display in the main window
#
# optional, default: name of the pilot disk
#

# try to prevent spurious input when the draco/dwarf-windows receives the input focus?
# (does not really work, sorry about this)
#
# optional, default: true
#
resetKeysOnFocusLost = true


#
# ####### network settings
#

# network configuration: host for the Dodo nethub to connect to
#
# optional, default: (none)

# (if no host is given, the network will be reduced to an internal time service responder,
# but with no outside network connections)

#
# ####### local time settings
#
# (not necessary if a network and specifically Dodo services is used, as these are specified there)
#

# when the system is run without network (i.e. using the internal time service responder):
# offset to GMT in minutes for the time zone (e.g. Berlin with DST: +120)
#
# optional, default: 0

# ####### XDE speciality
#

# work-around for the blinking "Time not set! Create no files!" text in the HeraldWindow
# instead of the current date/time.
#
# (this blinking text is used if the current time is not in certain time frame starting
# with the build-time of the Tajo/CoPilot-bootfile)
#
# the work-around is to fake the current time to a date in this time frame until the
# HeraldWindow has probably checked the time and then get back to the real time; the delay
# for the reverting to the real time is given as number of instructions, expressed in
# 100.000 executed instructions.
#
# syntax:
#   xdeNoBlinkWorkAround: <100thousand-instructions> : <iso-date>
#
# the following is for XDE 5.0 => Tajo/CoPilot 12.3 => build date: Oct, 3 1986
